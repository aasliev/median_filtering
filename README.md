1.	What is median filtering algorithm?
2.	Advantages/Disadvantages

>Introduction

The median filter is an effective method that can, to some extent, distinguish out-of-range isolated noise from legitimate 
image features such as edges and lines. Specifically, the median filter replaces a pixel by the median. We use median filters 
to reduce the noises, Gaussian or Salt and Pepper noise. 

>Advantages/Disadvantages

>>Advantages:
    a.	It works very good with Gaussian or Salt and Pepper noises.
    
    b.	Easy to implement.
    
>>Disadvantages:
    a.	Edge problem.
    
    b.	If the image has a good quality it makes it blurry.
    
    c.	Nonlinear time.
